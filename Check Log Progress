By executing a CHECKPOINT, we get a clean starting point. Then we can check the log records before and after the TRUNCATE TABLE.

USE demo;
CHECKPOINT;
 
  SELECT COUNT(*) [StartingLogRowCount]
  FROM sys.fn_dblog (NULL, NULL);
 
  TRUNCATE TABLE [dbo].[Test];
 
  SELECT COUNT(*) [LogRowCountAfterTruncate]
  FROM sys.fn_dblog (NULL, NULL);
