Troubleshooting Performance issues:

--Total and Available Memory:
--This query provides information about the total physical memory and available physical memory on the server.


SELECT
    total_physical_memory_kb / 1024.0 AS TotalMemoryGB,
    available_physical_memory_kb / 1024.0 AS AvailableMemoryGB
FROM
    sys.dm_os_sys_memory
WITH (NOLOCK);


--Memory Usage by SQL Server:
--This query shows how much memory SQL Server is currently using and the amount of available memory in the paging file.

SELECT
    (total_page_file_kb - available_page_file_kb) / 1024.0 AS UsedMemoryGB,
    available_page_file_kb / 1024.0 AS AvailableMemoryGB
FROM
    sys.dm_os_sys_memory
WITH (NOLOCK);


--Buffer Pool Usage:
--This query provides information about the number of pages in the buffer pool and the size of the buffer pool.

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS NumberOfBuffers,
    COUNT(*) * 8 / 1024.0 AS BufferPoolSizeMB
FROM
    sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors
WITH (NOLOCK);


--Memory Clerk Usage:
--This query shows memory usage by different memory clerks, helping you identify areas of memory consumption.

SELECT
    type,
    SUM(single_pages_kb + multi_pages_kb) / 1024.0 AS MemoryUsedMB
FROM
    sys.dm_os_memory_clerks
GROUP BY
    type
ORDER BY
    MemoryUsedMB DESC;

--Memory Grants Pending:
--This query indicates the number of queries waiting for memory grants, which could suggest memory pressure.


SELECT
    st.text AS QueryText,
    r.session_id,
    r.request_id,
    r.wait_type,
    r.wait_resource
FROM
    sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.plan_handle) st
WHERE
    r.wait_type LIKE 'RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE';




-- This query not only looks for queries waiting for memory grants (RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE) but also includes other common wait types related to resource contention.

SELECT
    st.text AS QueryText,
    r.session_id,
    r.request_id,
    r.wait_type,
    r.wait_resource,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.logical_reads,
    r.reads,
    r.writes
FROM
    sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.plan_handle) st
WHERE
    r.wait_type LIKE 'RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE'
    OR r.wait_type LIKE 'RESOURCE_GOVERNOR_IDLE'
    OR r.wait_type LIKE 'RESOURCE_QUEUE'
ORDER BY
    r.total_elapsed_time DESC;
