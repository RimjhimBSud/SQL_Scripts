/*

Explanation:
sys.indexes: This view gives information about all indexes in the database.
sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats: This dynamic management view tracks usage statistics for each index (seeks, scans, lookups, and updates).
The script joins these views and filters out:
Primary key indexes (i.is_primary_key = 0),
Unique indexes (i.is_unique = 0),
Disabled indexes (i.is_disabled = 0),
Tables without a clustered index (heaps).
It then checks if the index has had no seeks, scans, or lookups by filtering for indexes where these metrics are 0.

Notes:

The information in sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats is reset when the SQL Server restarts, so make sure you're working with enough uptime to have reliable statistics.
Double-check before dropping: Just because an index hasn't been used recently doesn't mean it isn't useful. Some indexes may be used infrequently but are critical for specific queries or reports.
